  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    On each day of a sprint, the team holds daily meetings (“the daily scrum”). Meetings are typically held in the same&#xD;
    location and at the same time each day. Ideally the daily scrums are held in the morning as they help set the context&#xD;
    for the coming day's work.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    All team members are required to attend the daily scrum. Anyone else (for example, a departmental VP, a salesperson, or&#xD;
    a developer from another project) is allowed to attend but is there only to listen. This makes the daily scrums an&#xD;
    excellent way for a Scrum team to disseminate status information--if you're interested in hearing where things are at,&#xD;
    attend that day's meeting.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    The daily scrum is not used as a problem-solving or issue resolution meeting. Issues that are raised are taken offline&#xD;
    and usually dealt with by the relevant sub-group immediately after the daily scrum. During the daily scrum each team&#xD;
    member provides answers to the following three questions:&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    1. What did you do yesterday?&lt;br />&#xD;
    2. What will you do today?&lt;br />&#xD;
    3. Are there any impediments in your way?&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    By focusing on what each person accomplished yesterday and will accomplish today the team gains an excellent&#xD;
    understanding of what work has been done and what work remains. The daily scrum is not a status update meeting in which&#xD;
    a boss is collecting information about who is behind schedule. Rather, it is a meeting in which team members make&#xD;
    commitments to each other. If a programmer stands up and says &quot;Today I will finish the data storage module&quot; everyone&#xD;
    knows that in tomorrow's meeting he will say whether or not he did finish. This has the wonderful effect of helping a&#xD;
    team realize the significance of these commitments and that their commitments are to each other, not to some far-off&#xD;
    customer or salesman.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    In cases where the ScrumMaster cannot remove these impediments directly himself (e.g., usually the more technical&#xD;
    issues) he still takes responsibility for making sure someone on the team does quickly resolve the issue.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    在Sprint中，团队成员每天召开站立例会。会议通常安排在每天的同一地点和时间&amp;nbsp;。显然，在每天早上召开站立会议有助于安排一天的工作。&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    所有团队成员都要求参加该会议。任何其他人（例如：部门VP，销售人员，或来自其他项目的开发人员）允许参与会议，但仅能作为旁听者。这是Scrum团队公布状态信息的一条极佳的途径——如果你有兴趣了解当前事务进行到哪里，你可以参加这个会议。&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    每日站立会议不应该被用做问题解决会议。出现的问题，应该在每日会议之后，由相关小组立即认领并处理。在会议上，每一位成员需要回答下面三个问题：&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        昨天你做了什么？&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        今天你计划完成什么？&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        有什么问题对你造成了障碍？&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    通过聚焦于每个人昨天完成了什么、今天将要完成什么，团队对当前什么工作已经完成、什么没有完成有清晰地认识。每日会议不是状态更新会议，不是老板用来收集谁存在计划延迟信息的会议。相反，它是一个团队成员进行彼此承诺的会议。如果一个程序员站出来并且说“今天我将完成数据存储模块”，那么每个人都清楚在明天的会议中他将说“完成”或“未完成”。这对帮助团队实现这些承诺的意义有着极佳的帮助，他们彼此承诺，而不是针对某个遥远的客户或销售人员。&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    当Scrum Master自己无法直接消除障碍（例如，更多的技术讨论），他仍有责任确认团队中有人能够迅速解决这个问题。&#xD;

  <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    There is an old joke in which a chicken and a pig are talking and the chicken says, &quot;Let's start a restaurant.&quot; The pig&#xD;
    replies, &quot;Good idea, but what should we call it?&quot; &quot;How about 'Ham and Eggs'&quot; says the chicken. &quot;No thanks,&quot; says the&#xD;
    pig, &quot;I'd be committed, you'd only be involved.&quot; The joke is meant to point out the difference between those who are&#xD;
    committed on a project and those who are only involved. Scrum affords special status to those who are committed and&#xD;
    many teams enforce a rule in which only those who are committed are allowed to talk during the daily scrum.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Any impediments that are raised become the ScrumMaster's responsibility to resolve as quickly as possible. Typical&#xD;
    impediments are:&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
    * My ____ broke and I need a new one today.&lt;br />&#xD;
    * I still haven't got the software I ordered a month ago.&lt;br />&#xD;
    * I need help debugging a problem with ______.&lt;br />&#xD;
    * I'm struggling to learn ______ and would like to pair with someone on it.&lt;br />&#xD;
    * I can't get the vendor's tech support group to call me back.&lt;br />&#xD;
    * Our new contractor can't start because no one is here to sign her contract.&lt;br />&#xD;
    * I can't get the ____ group to give me any time and I need to meet with them.&lt;br />&#xD;
    * The department VP has asked me to work on something else &quot;for a day or two.&quot;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    这是一个关于“猪和火鸡”对话的老笑话。“我们一起开家餐厅吧”，猪回答说：“好主意，但是我们卖什么”&#xD;
